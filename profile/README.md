## Hi there 👋

Here is the code for the [MASCOT project](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot). We are intersted in improving how we sample with AUVs. We utilise onboard statistical model to improve real time descicions on where and when to sample. 


## Repo overwiev:

[GRANADE](https://github.com/MASCOT-NTNU/GRANADE): Finding large salinity gradients in water fronts.

[CALMSEA](https://github.com/MASCOT-NTNU/CALMSEA): Locating high densities of zooplankton or Chlorophyll A

The code is implemented on LAUVs from [OceanScan](https://www.oceanscan-mst.com/) and used in several field tests in Portugal and Norway.
